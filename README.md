# Hello, everyone! 😁  
My name is Marcelo Souza, and I'm in an exciting career transition to **Full Stack** development, with a special focus on **back-end**. I'm currently working on automation projects and a machine translation system that can be applied in various fields such as games, articles, and books. I'm also enhancing my skills through courses at Alura, focusing on **Python**, **APIs**, and **automation**.

Technology has always been a passion, and now I have the opportunity to turn that into a career. If you're interested in following my journey or exchanging ideas about automation and development, I'd love to connect with you!
